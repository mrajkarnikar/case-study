# Case Study of Coinbase

### Overview and Origin

### Name of company

Coinbase

### When was the company incorporated?

Coinbase, the company was founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam. On April 14, 2021, Coinbase went public on
the Nasdaq exchange

### Who are the founders of the company?

Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

In 2010, Bryan was a programmer at Airbnb with an ambition to start his own company. He came about a paper on the
internet on p2p digital currency called bitcoin on hacker news. He did not understand it the first time. But he realized
it was very important and ambitious. Most of the people at that time were deeply skeptical about the concept. For him,
that was the next internet. It was the idea that changed his life.

Brian had studied economics and he knew about US monetary policies. He also had operated his own tutoring business when
he was a student at Rice University. He had faced problems of dealing with money. He was big in not having a boss. He
wanted to do something that he would enjoy even if he did not make money. He wanted to be a tech entrepreneur. When he
joined Airbnb, Airbnb was expanding and trying to operate in 190 countries. Moving a lot of money which was hard. So he
understood the pain points and how bitcoin could solve those problems.

He worked on a prototype, a hosted digital wallet service for bitcoin. At that time, it was way too difficult to store
the bitcoin on a desktop. His product enabled safe storage of bitcoin in a wallet which then became Coinbase.

He worked from 8 pm to midnight every day while he was working at Airbnb. He got feedback that one of his customers who
loved the project abandoned it just because he did not have bitcoin. So he had to create a buy button. After this, his
product found market fit and it took off.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Brian met Ben reeves from the UK working on a similar thing. He had Ben fly to the US to present at Y-Combinator. Their
presentation won 150k. But things did not work out with Ben because he went back to the UK and missed a few important
meetings. He realized Ben was not equally committed

Brian was able to get 600k from the seed round. He continued working on his product and after some demo, Fred approached
him. He was driven, brought a lot of value and became the co-founder.

1 year after the launch, middle of 2013, Coinbase had 130k users. Brian raised 5 million in series A. At the same time
bitcoin dropped 80%

The company raised $547M in 17 funding rounds. When it went on IPO on Apr 14, 2021, it was valued at $86B with the share
price of $381. Coinbase is now one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, with 7.4 million monthly users,
2,700 employees and over 80 cryptocurrencies traded on its platform.[3]

in-house.

area where Defi apps are shining is DEXs. SushiSwap and Uniswap had January 2021’s monthly trading volume of $56
billion, an increase of over 1,000% from 2020’s high of $26 billion in September. Similarly, there are thousands of
Dapps mainly on Ethereum with games like upland rapidly growing

- #### NFT

One of the most interesting developments in the crypto space is the rise of NFT which are tokens that represent a
digital claim to unique things which can be digital or physical. They are created typically on Ethereum. NFT trading
volume grew 10x just in one month [5]

it has been made popular by marketplaces such as CryptoKitties and CryptoPunks. NFT is solving ownership and copyright
issues that have long plagued the art community.

### Results

### What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Coinbase has had a profound effect on cryptocurrency. A terminology has been coined called "Coinbase Effect". The theory
around the ‘Coinbase Effect’ is:
get listed on Coinbase, and the price will skyrocket. This is due to the fact that many coins and tokens have seen their
price rise after coinbase listing. Coinbase had the highest post-listing price response compared to exchanges like
Binance, FTX, OKEx, Kraken, or Gemini [2]

### What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

Approximately 73 million verified users, 10,000 institutions, and 185,000 ecosystem partners in over 100 countries trust
Coinbase to easily and securely invest, spend, save, earn, and use crypto.

### How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Out of the $206 billion held on centralized exchanges, Coinbase holds 35.84% with $73.84 billion held in reserves.
Binance holds 14.78% of the $206 billion with $30.46 billion. Both Bitmex and Bitflyer hold the least amount of crypto
reserves in the top ten positions, with Bitmex holding $7.27 billion and Bitflyer holding $4.89 billion in crypto
reserves[6].

When they did begin trading, Coinbase's shares surged, briefly shooting up 60% with a market value of nearly $86
billion. More than the market cap of the company Intercontinental Exchange Inc that owns the New York Stock Exchange,
which is the largest stock exchange in the world that was started in 1792. Coinbase, based in San Francisco, launched in
2012. The U.S.'s second-largest exchange, the Nasdaq, has a value of $27 billion.

Another competitor of Coinbase is DEX. Mainly Uniswap, Sushi, and PancakeSwap — three decentralized exchanges leading
the charge against Coinbase. Uniswap is currently the most popular by a significant margin. As of April 2021, Uniswap
had processed over $10 billion in weekly trading volume. The advantage of Coinbase over DEXs are fast trading(
instantaneously vs minutes even at the fastest gas setting), high liquidity, insured wallets, no gas cost

### Recommendations

Coinbase can work to lower its price. Coinbase is notorious for having higher fees [4]. Its competitor such as Binance
has been able to take advantage of it. Reducing such fees has help in further widen the adoption of the platform.

They can also work on advanced trading options such as multiple order types: Margin, options, derivative, and future.
Customer service is another area where the company is behind based on various surveys and users feedback

Another area where Coinbase can innovate is Metaverse. Metaverse, is an online virtual world made popular mostly by
facebook. It incorporates augmented and virtual reality, avatars, video and other means of communication. As the
metaverse expands with help of big companies like facebook and microsoft, it promises to offer a hyper-real alternative
world for users to coexist in. Some metaverse already exist in online game universes such as Fortnite, Minecraft and
Roblox. And the companies behind those games have ambitions to be part of the evolution of the metaverse. As far as
coinbase role is concerned in metaverse, they can create an identity on-ramp into the Metaverse. Create a unique
username NFT that resolves to a wallet, Eventually, this will allow users to carry a unique ID across different worlds
in the Metaverse. The link wallet can then be used to shop in metaverse. They can allow users to purchase avatar, define
and maintain their public profile, and establish trust. And they can have features like Sign in with Coinbase, which
could allow users to sign into every app in the Metaverse. This will further widen the usage of coinbase in everyday
life of people
